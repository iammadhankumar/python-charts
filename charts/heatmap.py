# A heatmap in Python is a graphical representation of data in a matrix format, where individual values are depicted by color gradients. 
# It's commonly used to visualize complex data patterns, correlations, or hierarchical relationships.
# If needed, install Seaborn
# pip install seaborn

# Generate random data for the heatmap
data = np.random.rand(10, 10) # Create a 10x10 matrix with random values between 0 and 1

# Create a heatmap with Seaborn
sns.heatmap(data, annot=True)

# Add a title to the heatmap
plt.title('Heatmap')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
